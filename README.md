# Logic Model - WIP

This app is an online logic model for public health practitioners. It uses React and Redux and is backed with an express server and MongoDb.

It is based on a number of react tutorials, especially [SurviveJS React](https://survivejs.com/react/) and [Mern Stack Crud App](https://medium.com/@vipinswarnkar1989/mern-stack-crud-app-using-create-react-app-react-redux-3299059db793)
